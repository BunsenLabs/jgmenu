Description and Key Features
----------------------------

  * jgmenu is a stand-alone, simple and contemporary-looking menu application
    for Linux and BSD.

  * Although it was originally written to be used with openbox and tint2,
    it is not in any way dependent on these and runs well with other panels
    and window managers.

  * It is hackable with a clean, small code base.

  * It can display the following types of menu (or any combination of):

      - bespoke menu using a jgmenu flavoured CSV format

      - application menu (XDG compatible) with localisation support

      - openbox XML menu including pipe-menus

  * It can display SVG, PNG and XPM icons.

  * It has UTF-8 search support.

  * It is highly customizable (e.g. colours, alignment, margins, padding,
    transparency).

  * It can synchronise with xsettings, GTK and tint2 settings.

  * It does not depend on any toolkits such as GTK and Qt, but uses cairo and
    pango to render the menu directly onto an X11 window.

  * It has been compiled and run on OpenBSD, FreeBSD and various Linux
    distributions including Bunsenlabs, Arch, Ubuntu, Alpine, Void and Mint.

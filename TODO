Key changes before v1.0
-----------------------

	Remove 'single window mode' and replace with ^root() and ^return()
	(consider how to set new root using a pipe)
	This will make code simpler and will reduce memory usage as surfaces
	can be kept smaller.

	Add widgets including icon, rect and text

	Add 4th field - comment (e.g. from generic name)

	Add 5th field - meta (e.g. with categories to enable filter buttons)
	Consider adding a ^filter()

Cleanliness
-----------

	jgmenu - warn if strange command line argument is given

	Refactor icon.c
		- merge struct icon and icon_path
		- is xdgdirs inited twice?
		- split icon.c into image.c and icon.c
		- rename functions (e.g. icon_set_name() --> icon_add())

	mv isprog.c jgmenu-path.c (or similar)

	checkout_parent(): consider the case when current window has child(ren)

	free string-lists with builtin sbuf_ function

	Remove parse_caret_action (it was only really good for deleting the
	closing bracket which we do up-front now anyway)

	Simplify geometry.c by enabling access to config.h variables

	add gcc -M auto-dependencies to Makefile

	in x11-ui.c, create
		- linked list of windows
		- 'static Window active_window' (instead of ui->w[ui->cur].win)
		- Write --help message.

	Pipemenu
		- check duplicate tag names
		- load icons for pipes

	parse-ob.c: remove return_cmd
			Read JGMENU_PREPEND_FILE env var (and read ~/.config/jgmenu/prepend.csv by default)
			Read stdin -->  exec in jgmenu_run
					stdin -> mkstemp /tmp/jgmenu-XXXXXX

	Move struct item/node code to data.c.
		  - Refactor all the checkout_* functions. They're confusing.

	The first item in master list is always a tag-item, so remove old code
	which handles exceptions

	Refactor around read_csv_file and creating items

	Remove spawn from config (make it args_ instead).

	Draw diagrams of variables

	Replace strdups+free with x-alternatives
		replace various warn() with BUG_ON

	Set by argv_buf delim by default to make it 'safer'

	Add explaination on JGMENU_EXEC_PATH

	Rename filter list (as it clashes with filter_) (maybe 'disp'?)

	Add shareness with symlinks

	Remove harded coded variables (such as 22, etc)

New features
------------

	Add jgmenu-lx generic name and add LX=1 to Makefile

	Highlight correct parent item when submenu open

	Add jgmenu-xdg.c localisation

	xdg: read xfce menu

	jgmenu-init.sh:
	  - put backup files in backup/ directory
	  - add --clean to remove all config files
	  - jgmenu init --append,--prepend, --jgmenurc
	    Let jgmenu init call all three to create a simple basic setup
	    Add "init --purge" to remove all three.
	  - Add an experimental "init --theme=neon"

	Add watch.c to check changes to .desktop files, tint2, xsettings, jgmenurc,
	etc. on wake-up
		- Check tint2rc 'modified time' and re-read on change
		- Consider the same for jgmenurc and tint2-sessionfile (bl)

	Add support for "fixed-position" items such as icons/images and
	shapes (incl search box)

	Explore pango markup

	Add menu_height config option

	Set width when filter applied (long items don't currently fit)

	Add CENTER to menu_halign and menu_valign

	Add scroll_bar

	Support for adding favourites in real-time (e.g. keyboard shortcut for
	locking menu-item onto the root menu - or similar)

	Consider "hover" features and "inline expansion" of menus

DEVELOPMENT NOTES
=================

Upversion
---------
  - update "default_version" in scripts/version-gen.sh
  - update debian/changelog
  - create docs/relnotes/X.Y.txt
  - git tag -a 'vX.Y'

Adding new config variables
---------------------------
Any new config variables need to be added to the following:
  - config.c
  - config.h
  - docs/jgmenurc
  - jgmenu-init.sh
  - docs/manual/jgmenu-config.1.md

Testing
-------
make ex		Runs a few menus specifically designed to test the code

make check	Checks coding style

		To just check a specific .c or .h file, do
			./scripts/checkpatch-wrapper foo.c

make test	Runs tests of specific modules (still to be implemented)

APIs
----
list.h

hashmap.c

Architecture
------------
jgmenu_run is a wrapper calling jgmenu-<command>

`jgmenu_run` makes jgmenu easier to use by  
  - creating a simple interface for common commands
  - saving the user having to remember script file extensions

It also helps keep $prefix/bin tidier by putting all the other scripts in
$libexecdir.

Grammar
-------
jgmenu is always written with a lowercase "j". It should be obvious from the  
context if we refer to the entire application or just the binary file.
